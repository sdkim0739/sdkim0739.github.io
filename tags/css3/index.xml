      <description>As the only CS major amongst our Ethics Bowl crew, I&amp;rsquo;ve been summoned to create our Ethics Bowl team website.
Below is a sneak peek at the current design:
Using my own custom HTML/CSS, I&amp;rsquo;m customizing the Dopetrope template from HTML5UP to suit our design needs. The color scheme consists of mainly UChicago brand colors.
I plan to incorporate more custom JavaScript or React Native to make the landing page more dynamic, e.</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;by &amp;ldquo;part of a development team&amp;rdquo;, I mean being one of two cadets who can edit HTML in my detachment. Hehe.
Anyways!
Since the website for our detachment is rather outdated and archived, we&amp;rsquo;re dusting it off and hoping to release a fresh website with a new design by fall of 2022.
So far, the design has been under wraps, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have any images yet! It&amp;rsquo;s going to be a classic HTML5/CSS3 framework, customizing off of an existing template.</description>

      <description>While I worked as a Summer Technician at UChicago Housing Technology in 2020, I created an internal metrics visualization page powered by Go to display our logs.
I wish I had code or images to link to, but unfortunately, all the work is housed internally and can&amp;rsquo;t be shared. However, I used the go-echarts plugin to make the foundation, which you can find here!</description>

      <description>Back when I was a wee high school sophomore in 2017, a couple of my friends and I prototyped an app at the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program.
And EsteemBeam was born!
EsteemBeam is an iOS/Android app that sends self-help and motivational phrases at the user&amp;rsquo;s specified frequency â€“ daily, weekly, monthly, etc. Our target demographic was young girls, since the app&amp;rsquo;s phrases were formulated with common mental health struggles of adolescent girls in mind, such as body image or peer pressure.</description>
