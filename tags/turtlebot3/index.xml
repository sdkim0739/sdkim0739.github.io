      <description>During the summer of 2021, one of my projects at the UChicago Human-Robot Interaction Lab included assisting Dr. Sarah Sebo in preparing her Introduction to Robotics curriculum for in-person instruction.
Accordingly, with the help of my labmate Jason Lin, we spearheaded the design and construction of a physical maze for the Particle Filter Localization project, which involves tracking a Turtlebot3 in a maze using a particle filter localization algorithm.

      <description>During the Winter 2021 Introduction to Robotics class, my teammate and I implemented a Q-Learning algorithm in Python3/ROS and trained a Turtlebot3 in Gazebo to match dumbbells to numbered blocks.
This project involved a mix of robot kinematics, vision recognition, and reinforcement learning in order to train the Turtlebot.
Check out one of our test runs below:
